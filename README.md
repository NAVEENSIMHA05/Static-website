RightDoor â€“ A Platform for Aspiring Filmmakers
Project Overview:

Whether you're a Director, VFX Artist, or Makeup Artist, this platform allows you to express your passion by applying to one of 24 key filmmaking crafts with your resume and portfolio.

Server-Side Functionality:
While the frontend of RightDoor handles the visual experience and user interaction, the server-side plays a vital role behind the scenes. Itâ€™s where the real action happens â€” storing resumes, managing form submissions, and preparing everything for shortlisting.
Imagine the frontend as a movie set and the backend as the production crew making everything run smoothly â€” invisible, but essential.
 What the Server Does?
1.	Receives the Application Submission
When a user submits their resume and experience through the application form, the server takes that data and handles it securely â€” just like a casting assistant collecting audition files.
2.	Stores the Resume File
It saves the uploaded PDF resume in a specific folder (like a digital file cabinet), so it can be reviewed later by the admin or selection panel.
3.	Keeps a Record of the Applicant's Details
The backend stores all key data:
o	Applicantâ€™s name
o	Email and phone
o	Selected craft
o	Experience description
o	Resume filename and path
This can be saved in a file (for small projects) or in a database like MongoDB or MySQL for more robust systems.
4.	Protects Against Invalid Data
The server only accepts PDF resumes, blocks large files, and prevents any kind of hacking attempts by sanitizing inputs â€” like a smart bouncer at the door.
